HTTP defines a set of status codes that the server includes in the response to indicate the result of a client's request. 

These status codes are grouped into different classes to convey specific information about the request or the server's response. 

Here are the different classes of HTTP status codes:

## Informational (1xx):

-   100 Continue: The server has received the initial part of the request and is willing to process the client's remaining request.
-   101 Switching Protocols: The server agrees to switch protocols and is changing the protocol used in the response.

## Successful (2xx):

-   200 OK: The request has succeeded, and the server has returned the requested resource.
-   201 Created: The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.
-   204 No Content: The server successfully processed the request but does not need to return any content in the response.

## Redirection (3xx):

-   301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URI.
-   302 Found: The requested resource temporarily resides under a different URI.
-   304 Not Modified: The client's cached version of the requested resource is still valid, and there is no need to transfer the same content again.

## Client Error (4xx):

-   400 Bad Request: The server cannot process the request due to malformed syntax or other client errors.
-   403 Forbidden: The server understands the request but refuses to fulfill it, usually due to authentication or authorization issues.
-   404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server.

## Server Error (5xx):

-   500 Internal Server Error: A generic server error occurred, indicating that something went wrong on the server.
-   503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to maintenance, overload, or other temporary issues.
-   504 Gateway Timeout: The server acting as a gateway or proxy did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.
