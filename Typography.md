## Text size and line height

	 The larger the text size , the smaller the line height

- to level up , use line height 1.1 to 1.3 times the text size for your headings
- for paragraphs / body , use line height 1.3 to 1.5 x the size of the text

## Letter spacing

- try using negative letter spacing for your heading text :
- ie, -0.5%, -1% , 1.5% (based on the font)

## Text alignment

- use center align only for short text or headings.
- for large body , center align makes it harder to read (hard to find start)
- in general,dont mix center align heading and left align body text
- any thing that spans over 3 lines , go for left align

## Line length

- users dont tend to read long lines of text as they find it boring and defficult to understand
- **The optimal width for a body text is b/w 50-75 chars.**
- for desktop screen 600 px is a good width

## Text hyrarchy

- dont overly use text fonts or text width 
- instead use 2 font sizes and use font weight and small colour changes to inticate hyrarchy

## Spacing in b/w texts

- if there are 2 paras with heading , the second heading should be 
  2X times the distance b/w 2nd heading and its body
